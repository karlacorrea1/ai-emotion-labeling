I trusted you with parts of me I don’t share with anyone. And you used them against me. I’m furious. It’s not just betrayal—it’s a complete gut punch. I’m so angry I could scream."

The police didn’t hesitate to intimidate him, hand on the holster, voice full of assumption. And everyone just kept walking. I’m so tired of seeing this. I’m so tired of the system pretending it’s neutral. I’m enraged. How many times do we have to scream to be heard?"

    "text": "I said no. I made it clear. And still, you pushed. You touched without permission. You kept asking after I said I was done. That’s not persistence—it’s a violation. I’m furious. I deserve to feel safe in my space, and you stole that. This anger sits deep in my chest like fire."
